Dynamic libraries project
Dynamic libraries provide a code that can be loaded anywhere in the memory. Once loaded, the library code can be used by any number of programs. This way the size of programs using dynamic library and the memory footprint can be kept low as possible.
To create a dynamic library in Linux, simply type the following command: gcc *. c -c -fPIC and hit return. This command essentially generates one object file .o for each source file.
